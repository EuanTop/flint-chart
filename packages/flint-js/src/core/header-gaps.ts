 * The air around a chart's keys and within its header, in em of the keys' type — so it keeps its
 * proportion to the text it separates — eased with the plot's size, so a small tile packs a little
 * closer and a large chart breathes a little more, rather than a fixed 18 px that is nothing on a
 * large chart and a key row's worth on a small one.
 *
 * The header — the headline, its deck and any keys above the plot — is grouped by its gaps: keys one
 * above another stand closest, as one group; the title block stands clearly further over them than
 * its deck's own leading, so the keys do not read as another line of it; and the block stands
 * further again from the plot — the theme's title gap, held between a little more and a few times
 * the title's gap to the keys, so the header neither runs into the plot nor floats off it. A key
 * with no title above it keeps its own gap to the plot. A theme sets any of them (`legend.gaps`),
 * and what it sets stands as set.
